# DEMP: Docker + Nginx + MySQL + PHP

This repository already has all the configuration for you to run and debug applications build with PHP.

I recently participated in some projects that used PHP as technology, so I decided to put these things inside a docker container and that's it.

But I had some difficulty getting debugging applications that were running inside the container.

Hope this helps everyone.
